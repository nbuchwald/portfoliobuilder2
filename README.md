# portfoliobuilder2

The concept for “Portfolio Builder” was developed in my Learning Media Design course, taught by Professor Marti Louw. As a team comprised of both graduate students and undergraduate students, we developed a “Portfolio Builder” to address the needs of students and teachers. If you are interested about the design process behind this concept, then please refer to my blog (https://medium.com/the-open-portfolio-project). 


The Portfolio Builder addresses the common problems that many students face presently in education. Simply, students do not adequately document, share, and reflect upon their work. These three learning science principles are crucial for personal development. Therefore, my distributed application aims to encapsulate those principles and provide value for students. 


Unfortunately, due to the time crunch for this project, I could not fully implement my team’s vision for this portfolio builder. I have only provided a glimpse into the student side. I will hopefully expand the student-teacher connection in the future.

Thanks to many Node.js, Express.js, and Mongoose tutorials I was able to get this application to work. I have modelled some of my code based off the following tutorial. https://www.airpair.com/javascript/complete-expressjs-nodejs-mongodb-crud-skeleton


Additionally, I have used Start Bootstrap’s template for the design of my application:
